# DNA Sequencing with Machine Learning

In this Data Science Project, I will apply a classification model with Machine Learning that can predict a gene's function based on the DNA sequencing of the coding sequence alone.

## Overview

This project focuses on DNA sequencing analysis using a classification model. The goal is to predict the function of a gene based on its DNA sequence. The project utilizes a multinomial naive Bayes classifier and applies the Bag of Words approach using CountVectorizer for feature extraction.

## Files

The following files are used in this project:

- `DNA_Sequencing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
- `human_data.txt`: Data file containing human DNA sequence coding regions and class labels.
- `chimp_data.txt`: Data file containing chimpanzee DNA sequence coding regions and class labels.
- `dog_data.txt`: Data file containing dog DNA sequence coding regions and class labels.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- `numpy` 
- `pandas` 
- `matplotlib` 
- `scikit-learn` 

## Installation
You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/viv3k19/DNA_Sequencing-using-Python-ML.git
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook DNA_Sequencing.ipynb in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).

3. Run the notebook cells to execute the code step by step.
